# GoBanter ðŸ’¬

GoBanter is a lightweight, real-time chat application built in Go. It uses Gorilla WebSocket for seamless real-time communication, Pat URL pattern muxer for routing, and jQuery for simple front-end interactions. Perfect for learning or deploying a scalable chat system with minimal overhead.

## Features
- **Real-time Messaging**: Powered by WebSockets for instant communication.
- **Simple & Lightweight**: Easy to set up and run with minimal dependencies.
- **Cross-Device Support**: Accessible from multiple devices simultaneously.
- **Customizable**: A great foundation to build your chat application.

## WebSocket Message Format

GoBanter uses simple JSON messages over the WebSocket. Every message is an object with an "Action" field (string) and a "Payload" field (object). The server and clients rely on the Action value to determine how to handle the Payload.

Supported action types (common examples)
- "username" â€” client sets or updates their username.
- "broadcast" â€” client sends a chat message to be broadcast to all connected users; server forwards broadcast events to clients.
- "left" â€” server notifies clients that a user disconnected.
- "connected" â€” server notifies clients that a user connected (or server acknowledges a new connection).
- Additional actions may be defined (e.g., "userlist", "history") depending on server extensions.

Common payload fields
- Message (string) â€” the chat text.
- Username (string) â€” display name of the sender.
- Conn (string) â€” connection identifier assigned by the server (useful to disambiguate users).
- Time (string, RFC3339) â€” optional timestamp included by the server.
- Any other fields are considered extension-specific.

Sample JSON messages

Client -> Server (set username)
```json
{
  "Action": "username",
  "Payload": {
    "Username": "alice"
  }
}
```

Client -> Server (send a chat message)
```json
{
  "Action": "broadcast",
  "Payload": {
    "Message": "Hello, everyone!",
    "Username": "alice"
  }
}
```

Server -> Clients (broadcast received message)
```json
{
  "Action": "broadcast",
  "Payload": {
    "Message": "Hello, everyone!",
    "Username": "alice",
    "Conn": "conn_abc123",
    "Time": "2025-10-06T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Server -> Clients (user left)
```json
{
  "Action": "left",
  "Payload": {
    "Username": "alice",
    "Conn": "conn_abc123"
  }
}
```

Notes
- Implementations should gracefully ignore unknown Action values to remain forward-compatible.
- The server may add extra metadata fields in Payload; clients should only process known fields.
